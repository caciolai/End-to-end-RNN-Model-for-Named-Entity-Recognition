# End to end RNN Model for Named Entity Recognition

This project implements a *BiLSTM*-based model to capture token-tag features from character-level and POS embeddings to perform *Named Entity Recognition* (NER) in a given text.

### Implementation

[Here](code.ipynb) is a copy of the Colab notebook in which I implemented my model and carried out its training.

### Report

[Here](report.pdf) is the report with the documentation of my model and the results it attains.
