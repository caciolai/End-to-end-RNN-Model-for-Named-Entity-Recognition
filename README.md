# End to end RNN Model for Named Entity Recognition

This project implements a *BiLSTM*-based model to capture token-tag features from character-level and POS embeddings to perform *Named Entity Recognition* (**NER**) in a given text.

## Implementation

[Here](notebooks/training.ipynb) is a copy of the Colab notebook in which I trained and evaluated the model.

## Report

[Here](reports/report.pdf) is the report with the documentation of my model and the results it attains.
